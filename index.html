<h2> The main muscle groups and exercises </h2>
<h3 style = "text-decoration: underline"> Chest </h3>
<div class = "lineup">
<div class = "textcolumn">
<p>The chest isn't an incredibly complicated muscle group, with only three muscles making up a large area. The pec major is the one most commonly focused on, 
    as it is the largest of the muscles in your chest. It is the thick, fan shaped muscle above the smaller serratus muslces on your rib cage, and hides the pec 
    minor behind it. The best way to train all 3 muscles is with some of these simple movements:  </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Push-ups (bodyweight exercise)</li>
        <li>Dips (bodyweight exercise)</li>
        <li>Incline, wide-grip, partial range-of-motion bench press</li>
        <li>Bench press (all other variations)</li>
        <li>Cable flyes (any variation)</li>
    </ul>

<h3 style = "margin-top: 20px; text-decoration: underline">Triceps</h3>
<div class = "lineup" style="margin-top: 25px;">
<div class = "textcolumn">
    <p> Some beginners will focus on the biceps for building muscular arms, however the triceps make up two-thirds of your upper arm, so start there!
        The triceps consist of three different heads: the long head, lateral head, and medial head. The long head runs along the back of the 
        arm and is responsible for shoulder and elbow extension. It is the largest of the three heads and contributes to the bulk of the triceps. 
        Situated underneath the long head, the medial head is less visible but plays a crucial role in elbow extension. Finally, located on 
        the outer side of the arm, the lateral head assists primarily in elbow extension and is often more visible, especially when the arm is flexed. 
        Some good exercises for targeting the triceps are:
    </p> 
    <ul>
        <li>Narrow grip dips (bodyweight exercise)</li>
        <li>Cable tricep pushdown</li>
        <li>Barbell/ cable skullcrushers</li>
    </ul>

<h3 style = "margin-top: 20px; text-decoration: underline">Abs</h3>
<div class = "lineup" style="margin-top: 25px">
<div class = "textcolumn">
    <p>
        Ab development is one of the most desired fitness goals, however very little people understand the seperate muscles.
        The abs have four main muscles making up the area. The rectus abdominis is the most recognized, often referred to as the "six-pack," 
        and runs vertically along the front of the abdomen. 
        Flanking it are the external obliques, which are located on the sides and help you twist your body and bend side to side. Beneath them are the internal obliques, 
        which also aid in trunk movement (twisting your body) but work in the opposite direction. The external and internal obliqes are generally grouped together 
        as the 'obliques' Finally, the transverse abdominis is the deepest layer, wrapping around the 
        torso to provide core stability and support. 
        
        So how do you get a 6-pack? Well, ab development is heavily dependent on diet, as you might expect, and simply doing ab exercises will not remove as much stomach fat 
        as you might want. Moreover, the abs are used in a lot of compound movements, such as squats, which is why, despite them being incredibly important muscles for stability,
        you might never see a powerlifter doing exercises solely focused on the abs. However, if you would like to 'fine tune' what you see, some exercises for building a strong 
        midsection are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Crunches (targets the rectus abdominis)</li>
            <li>Sit-ups (targets the rectus abdominis)</li>
            <li>Plank (targets the rectus abdominis)</li>
            <li>Leg-raises (targets the rectus abdominis)</li>
            <li>Reverse crunches (targets the rectus abdominis)</li>
            <li>Side plank (targets the obliques)</li>
            <li>Russian twists (targets the obliques)</li>
            <li>Bicycle crunches (targets the obliques)</li>
        </ul>

<h3 style = "margin-top: 50px; text-decoration: underline">Biceps</h3>
<div class = "lineup">
<div class = "textcolumn">
    <p> Your biceps brachii have two heads, short and long. They are responsible for elbow flexion, and they act in opposition to the triceps. 
        The brachialis, muscles which sit underneath your biceps, also assists the biceps in flexing the elbow. The brachialis is mostly out of
        sight and out of mind, but showing it some attention can be effective for rounding out your upper arms and getting stronger. 
        Endless variations of biceps curls exist, but many of them are unecessarily complicated, or just unecessary, so try making these exercises your staples: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Narrow grip pullups (bodyweight exercise)</li>
            <li>Dumbell bicep curls</li>
            <li>Dumbell hammer curls</li>
            <li>Standing barbell curls</li>
            <li>Cross body hammer curls (brachialis exercise)</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

<h3 style = "margin-top: 50px; text-decoration: underline"> Shoulders </h3>
<div class = "lineup">
    <div class = "textcolumn">
        <p> The shoulder joint is one of the most delicate joints in your body and is involved in all upper body movements. 
        The deltoids, located on either side of the collarbone, consist of three main parts: anterior (front), lateral (side), and posterior (rear) heads.

        Training the anterior deltoids enhances the front of the shoulders, while the rear delts add depth to the back. Focusing on the lateral 
        deltoids makes the shoulders appear wider. Strengthening these shoulder muscles improves overall power and function, and can also create the illusion 
        of a smaller waist, giving a curvy look for women and a "V" shape for men.
        
        When you lift weights, it's impossible not to train your shoulders, but if you really want to specificly strengthen your delts, these 
        compound and isolation movements will target them: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Standing overhead barbell press</li>
            <li>Dumbell/ machine shoulder press</li>
            <li>Dumbell/cable lateral raises</li>
        </ul>

<h3 style = "margin-top: 50px; text-decoration: underline"> Glutes </h3>
<div class = "lineup">
<div class = "textcolumn">
            <p> The gluteal muscles (or glutes) consist of three main parts: the gluteus maximus, the gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus. The gluteas maximus is the 
                largest and most superficial of the glute muscle, and it plays a key role in hip extension, outward rotation and stabilization of the pelvis. The gluteas medius
                is located underneath the maximus and is important for hip stabilization and movement. It primarily assists with hip abduction (lifting the leg away from the body). The 
                gluteas minimus is the smallest and deepest of the glutes, located beneath the gluteas medius, and also assists with hip abduction and internal rotation. Your glutes  
                is the single largest muscle in your body, as well as one of the most important for athletic performance and looking good, so how do you train it?
            </p> 
            <ul>
                <li>SQUATS! I cannot emphasise enough that you only need one exercise to train all of the muscles in your legs, and that is squats.</li>
                <li>Barbell/ machine hip thrusts</li>
                <li>Dumbell bulgarian split squats</li>
