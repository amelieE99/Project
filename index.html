<h1> The main muscle groups and exercises </h1>
<h2 style = "text-decoration: underline"> Chest </h2>
<div class = "lineup">
<div class = "textcolumn">
<p>The chest isn't an incredibly complicated muscle group, with only three muscles making up a large area. The pec major is the one most commonly focused on, 
    as it is the largest of the muscles in your chest. It is the thick, fan shaped muscle above the smaller serratus muscles on your rib cage, and hides the pec 
    minor behind it. The best way to train all 3 muscles is with some of these simple movements:  </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Push-ups (bodyweight exercise)</li>
        <li>Dips (bodyweight exercise)</li>
        <li>Incline, wide-grip, partial range-of-motion bench press</li>
        <li>Bench press (all other variations)</li>
        <li>Cable flyes (any variation)</li>
    </ul>

<h2 style = "margin-top: 20px; text-decoration: underline">Triceps</h2>
<div class = "lineup" style="margin-top: 25px;">
<div class = "textcolumn">
    <p> Some beginners will focus on the biceps for building muscular arms, however the triceps make up two-thirds of your upper arm, so start there!
        The triceps consist of three different heads: the long head, lateral head, and medial head. The long head runs along the back of the 
        arm and is responsible for shoulder and elbow extension. It is the largest of the three heads and contributes to the bulk of the triceps. 
        Situated underneath the long head, the medial head is less visible but plays a crucial role in elbow extension. Finally, located on 
        the outer side of the arm, the lateral head assists primarily in elbow extension and is often more visible, especially when the arm is flexed. 
        Some good exercises for targeting the triceps are:
    </p> 
    <ul>
        <li>Narrow grip dips (bodyweight exercise)</li>
        <li>Cable tricep pushdown</li>
        <li>Barbell/ cable skullcrushers</li>
    </ul>

<h2 style = "margin-top: 20px; text-decoration: underline">Abs</h2>
<div class = "lineup" style="margin-top: 25px">
<div class = "textcolumn">
    <p>
        Ab development is one of the most desired fitness goals, however very little people understand the seperate muscles.
        The abs have four main muscles making up the area. The rectus abdominis is the most recognized, often referred to as the "six-pack," 
        and runs vertically along the front of the abdomen. 
        Flanking it are the external obliques, which are located on the sides and help you twist your body and bend side to side. Beneath them are the internal obliques, 
        which also aid in trunk movement (twisting your body) but work in the opposite direction. The external and internal obliques are generally grouped together 
        as the 'obliques' Finally, the transverse abdominis is the deepest layer, wrapping around the 
        torso to provide core stability and support. 
        
        So how do you get a 6-pack? Well, ab development is heavily dependent on diet, as you might expect, and simply doing ab exercises will not remove as much stomach fat 
        as you might want. Moreover, the abs are used in a lot of compound movements, such as squats, which is why, despite them being incredibly important muscles for stability,
        you might never see a powerlifter doing exercises solely focused on the abs. However, if you would like to 'fine tune' what you see, some exercises for building a strong 
        midsection are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Crunches (targets the rectus abdominis)</li>
            <li>Sit-ups (targets the rectus abdominis)</li>
            <li>Plank (targets the rectus abdominis)</li>
            <li>Leg-raises (targets the rectus abdominis)</li>
            <li>Reverse crunches (targets the rectus abdominis)</li>
            <li>Side plank (targets the obliques)</li>
            <li>Russian twists (targets the obliques)</li>
            <li>Bicycle crunches (targets the obliques)</li>
        </ul>

<h2 style = "margin-top: 50px; text-decoration: underline">Biceps</h2>
<div class = "lineup">
<div class = "textcolumn">
    <p> Your biceps brachii have two heads, short and long. They are responsible for elbow flexion, and they act in opposition to the triceps. 
        The brachialis, muscles which sit underneath your biceps, also assists the biceps in flexing the elbow. The brachialis is mostly out of
        sight and out of mind, but showing it some attention can be effective for rounding out your upper arms and getting stronger. 
        Endless variations of biceps curls exist, but many of them are unnecessarily complicated, or just unnecessary, so try making these exercises your staples: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Narrow grip pullups (bodyweight exercise)</li>
            <li>Dumbell bicep curls</li>
            <li>Dumbell hammer curls</li>
            <li>Standing barbell curls</li>
            <li>Cross body hammer curls (brachialis exercise)</li>
        </ul>
        </div>

<h2 style = "margin-top: 50px; text-decoration: underline"> Shoulders </h2>
<div class = "lineup">
    <div class = "textcolumn">
        <p> The shoulder joint is one of the most delicate joints in your body and is involved in all upper body movements. 
        The deltoids, located on either side of the collarbone, consist of three main parts: anterior (front), lateral (side), and posterior (rear) heads.

        Training the anterior deltoids enhances the front of the shoulders, while the rear delts add depth to the back. Focusing on the lateral 
        deltoids makes the shoulders appear wider. Strengthening these shoulder muscles improves overall power and function, and can also create the illusion 
        of a smaller waist, giving a curvy look for women and a "V" shape for men.
        
        When you lift weights, it's impossible not to train your shoulders, but if you really want to specifically strengthen your delts, these 
        compound and isolation movements will target them: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Standing overhead barbell press</li>
            <li>Dumbell/ machine shoulder press</li>
            <li>Dumbell/cable lateral raises</li>
        </ul>

<h2 style = "margin-top: 50px; text-decoration: underline"> Glutes </h2>
<div class = "lineup">
<div class = "textcolumn">
            <p> The gluteal muscles (or glutes) consist of three main parts: the gluteus maximus, the gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus. The gluteus maximus is the 
                largest and most superficial of the glute muscle, and it plays a key role in hip extension, outward rotation and stabilisation of the pelvis. The gluteus medius
                is located underneath the maximus and is important for hip stabilisation and movement. It primarily assists with hip abduction (lifting the leg away from the body). The 
                gluteus minimus is the smallest and deepest of the glutes, located beneath the gluteus medius, and also assists with hip abduction and internal rotation. Your glutes  
                is the single largest muscle in your body, as well as one of the most important for athletic performance and looking good, so how do you train it?
            </p> 
            <ul>
                <li>SQUATS! I cannot emphasise enough that you only need one exercise to train all of the muscles in your legs, and that is squats.</li>
                <li>Barbell/ machine hip thrusts</li>
                <li>Dumbell bulgarian split squats</li>
                <li>Deep goblet squats with a dumbell or kettlebell</li>

 <h2 style = "margin-top: 50px; text-decoration: underline"> Quadriceps </h2>
<div class = "lineup">
<div class = "textcolumn">
<p> The quadriceps (or quads) consist of four main muscles located in the front of your thighs- hence the name 'quad'. 
    These muscles work together to extend the knee and help with hip flexion, which is why it's very important to have strong quads.
    The Rectus Femoris is located centrally in the thigh and is the only muscle in your quads that crosses both the hip and knee joints. 
    This dual function allows it to assist in both knee extension and hip flexion. The Vastus Lateralis is positioned on the outer side of the thigh,
    and is the largest of the quad muscles, so it plays a significant role in stabilising the knee and in knee extension. The Vastus Medialis is found 
    on the inner part of the thigh and is essential for knee extension and the stabilisation of the kneecap. Finally, the Vastus Intermedius is located directly
    beneath the Rectus Femoris, and is not as visible but contributes to knee extension. Some good exercises for targeting your quads are:  
    </p> 
        <ul>
            <li>Squats</li>
            <li>Front squat variation (this is hard so not advised for beginners)</li>
            <li>Leg extension machine</li>
            <li>Leg press machine</li>
            </ul>

        <h2 style = "margin-top: 50px; text-decoration: underline"> Hamstrings </h2>
        <div class = "lineup">
        <div class = "textcolumn">
        <p> The hamstrings are made up of three muscles at the back of your thighs. These muscles work together primarily to flex the knee and assist
             with hip extension, making strong hamstrings essential for movements like walking, running, and squatting. The Biceps Femoris runs along the outer part of 
             the back of the thigh and has two heads: the long head and the short head. The long head helps with both knee flexion and hip extension, while the short head 
             assists primarily with knee flexion. The Semitendinosus is positioned on the inner side of the back of the thigh and assists in knee flexion, hip extension, 
             and internal rotation of the leg. Lastly, the Semimembranosus is located beneath the semitendinosus and also plays a role in knee flexion, hip extension, and 
             internal rotation of the leg.

        <div class = "lineup">
        <div class = "textcolumn">
        <p> There are several muscle groups in your back: the trapezius, rhomboids,
            and lats (or latissimus dorsi). </p>
            
            <p>Your trapezius is a long diamond shaped muscles 
            which extends from your skull all the way down to mid-back, and is responsible for
            moving your shoulder blades and supporting your arms. A lot of people don't realise that along with
            your upper traps, which are visible next to your neck, the trapezius also have middle/ lower aspects that shouldn't be neglected.
            </p>
            <p>Your rhomboids are a more neglected group, as they are essentially hidden underneath the trapezius, however they are responsible for 
            retracting and rotating your shoulder blades downward, meaning they are essential for good posture.</p>
            
            <p>Finally, your lats are the biggest 
            muscle in your body, and these flat, triangular muscles run all the way down from your mid-back to lower-back. They and are responsible 
            for vertical pulling movements, and they also help stabilise your upper body during horizontal pushing.
